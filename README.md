# SimpleFischMacro
A macro for the Roblox game Fisch, unlike some other macros, is still dependent on player input and not completely automated. I just want to streamline the process!
How to use:
-Step 1: In the game, click the button that hides the UIs.
-Step 2: Cast your rod.
-Step 3: Press Ctrl + W to enable UI Navigation, you can just press "\", of course, but this might be more convenient.
-Step 4: Press Ctrl + E to Shake, once, repeat this step until you catch a fish!
